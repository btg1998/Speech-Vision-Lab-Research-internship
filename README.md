# Speech-and-Vision-Lab-Research-internship
This repository contains code written during my Research Internship at Speech & Vision Lab, IIT Madras.

 I worked on a wide range of Topics during my Research Internship : 
 
 • Neural Network Classifier on MNIST Dataset implemented in Keras

 • Neural Network Classifier on CIFAR10 Dataset implemented in Pytorch
 
 • Stacked Auto Encoder Implementation in Pytorch on CIFAR - 10 & 100 Datasets
 
 • Recovered Layer Outputs and Image Embeddings from the above Stacked Auto Encoder 
 
 • Implemented Variational Auto - Encoders on MNIST to generate New and Novel Images
 
 • Implemented Generative Adversarial Nets on MNIST to generate New and Novel Images
 
I also worked on specific problems in Speaker Diarization and Unsupervised Deep 
Embedded Clustering. But due to copy-right issues at IIT - Madras, couldn't upload the
code related to these. But below is the abstract of what I did :

Deep Embedded Clustering 

  • Parameter Initialization with deep Stacked AutoEncoder 
  
  • Why SAE ?
  
  • SAE training
  
  • Parameter Optimization with Clustering 
  
  • Evaluation Metric - Unsupervised Clustering Accuracy 
  
  • Training Phase with optimized set of Hyper-Parameters 
  
  • Results on Data-Sets 

Improved Deep Embedded Clustering 

  • Issue with Deep Embedded Clustering 
  
  • Why Improved Deep Embedded Clustering ? 
  
  • Difference between DEC and IDEC - Network Structure 
  
  • Clustering and Reconstruction Loss 
  
  • Parameter Optimization and Updation in training 
  
  • Results on Data-Sets
